// A Flutter camera plugin for desktop platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows).
//
// This plugin implements CameraPlatform from camera_platform_interface,
// allowing it to work seamlessly with the standard camera package.
// Users simply add camera_desktop as a dependency and the standard
// CameraController works on desktop automatically.
