// Triple-buffer texture for safe GStreamer→Flutter frame delivery.
//
// - GStreamer streaming thread writes to buffers[write_idx].
// - After writing, it swaps write_idx ↔ ready_idx (under mutex).
// - Flutter render thread (copy_pixels) swaps ready_idx ↔ read_idx (under
//   mutex) and returns buffers[read_idx]. This buffer is safe because neither
//   the GStreamer thread nor the swap touches it until the next copy_pixels.
